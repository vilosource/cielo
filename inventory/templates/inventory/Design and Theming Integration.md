# CIELO Design and Theming Integration

This document outlines how the "Minton" admin template (from the `material` directory) was integrated into the CIELO Django application to provide a consistent and professional user interface.

## 1. Overview

The goal was to leverage a pre-built HTML admin theme to accelerate UI development. The "Minton" theme, found in the `material/` directory at the project root, provided a comprehensive set of styled pages and components. The integration process involved:

*   Identifying the core layout structure from the theme.
*   Organizing the theme's static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts) within Django's static file system.
*   Creating a new Django base template (`base_material.html`) that incorporates the theme's layout and asset links.
*   Adapting existing application-specific templates to extend this new base template and utilize the theme's styling for various UI elements (tables, cards, forms, etc.).

## 2. Static Asset Management

The static assets from the Minton theme (originally in `material/assets/`) were crucial for its appearance and functionality.

*   **Location:** All assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc.) from `material/assets/` were copied into the Django project under `/home/jasonvi/GitHub/cielo/common/static/material_theme/`.
    *   This creates a clear separation for the theme's assets and makes them manageable by Django's `staticfiles` app.
    *   For example, theme CSS files are now accessible via `{% static 'material_theme/css/...' %}`.
*   **Usage:** In the Django base template (`base_material.html`), all links to these assets were updated to use the `{% static %}` template tag.

## 3. Base Template (`base_material.html`)

A new primary base template, `/home/jasonvi/GitHub/cielo/common/templates/common/base_material.html`, was created. This file serves as the foundation for all themed pages in the application.

*   **Source Structure:** The overall HTML structure (doctype, head, body, wrapper, topbar, left-sidebar, content-page, footer) was derived from one of the Minton theme's core pages (e.g., `material/task-list.html` or `material/pages-starter.html`).
*   **Django Template Tags:**
    *   `{% load static %}`: Included at the top for static file access.
    *   `{% block title %}`: For setting the page title in the browser tab/window.
    *   `{% block page_title %}`: For the main heading displayed within the page content area.
    *   `{% block breadcrumb %}`: For rendering breadcrumb navigation.
    *   `{% block content %}`: The main block where child templates inject their specific page content.
    *   `{% block extra_head %}` and `{% block extra_js %}`: For page-specific CSS or JavaScript includes.
*   **Asset Linking:** All `<link>` (for CSS) and `<script>` (for JS) tags were updated to use `{% static 'material_theme/path/to/asset' %}`.
*   **Dynamic Elements:**
    *   **User Information:** The topbar and sidebar user sections dynamically display the logged-in user's name (`{{ user.username }}`) and provide links for "Logout" (`{% url 'users:logout' %}`), "Change Password" (`{% url 'users:change_password' %}`), and "Login" (`{% url 'users:login' %}`).
    *   **CIELO Navigation Sidebar:** The left sidebar's navigation menu (`<div id="sidebar-menu">`) is dynamically generated by iterating through the `{{ cielo_navigation_items }}` context variable (provided by `common.context_processors.cielo_navigation_context`). The HTML structure for the menu items and sub-menus was adapted from the Minton theme's sidebar styling to ensure visual consistency.

## 4. Application Template Adaptation

Existing Django application templates were modified to integrate with the new Minton theme.

*   **Extending the Base:** Each app template (e.g., `/home/jasonvi/GitHub/cielo/inventory/templates/inventory/virtual_machines.html`, `/home/jasonvi/GitHub/cielo/inventory/templates/inventory/storage_accounts.html`) now begins with `{% extends 'common/base_material.html' %}`.
*   **Content Blocks:** The specific content for each page is placed within the appropriate blocks defined in `base_material.html` (primarily `{% block content %}`, but also `{% block title %}`, `{% block page_title %}`, `{% block breadcrumb %}`).
*   **Styling UI Elements:**
    *   HTML structures for tables, cards, forms, buttons, etc., are now based on the examples found within the `material/*.html` files.
    *   For instance, the virtual machines list uses a card and table structure styled according to the Minton theme, replacing the previous simpler Bootstrap styling.
    *   CSS classes provided by the Minton theme (e.g., `card`, `card-body`, `table`, `dt-responsive`, `header-title`) are used to achieve the desired look and feel.

**Example: `/home/jasonvi/GitHub/cielo/inventory/templates/inventory/storage_accounts.html`**

This template demonstrates the integration:
```html
{% extends 'common/base_material.html' %}
{% load static %}

{% block title %}Storage Accounts{% endblock %}

{% block page_title %}Storage Accounts List{% endblock %}

{% block breadcrumb %}
<ul class="breadcrumb"> {# Note: The Minton theme might expect <ol class="breadcrumb"> #}
  <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="javascript: void(0);">Inventory</a></li>
  <li class="breadcrumb-item active">Storage Accounts</li>
</ul>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h4 class="header-title">Storage Account Listing</h4>
                <p class="text-muted font-13 mb-4">
                    List of all storage accounts in the inventory.
                </p>
                <table class="table table-striped"> {# Consider using theme-specific table classes e.g., from tables-datatable.html #}
                  <thead>
                    <tr>
                      <th>Name</th>
                      <th>Location</th>
                      <th>SKU</th>
                      <th>Access Tier</th>
                    </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    {% for sa in accounts %}
                    <tr>
                      <td>{{ sa.name }}</td>
                      <td>{{ sa.location }}</td>
                      <td>{{ sa.sku }}</td>
                      <td>{{ sa.tier }}</td>
                    </tr>
                    {% empty %}
                    <tr><td colspan="4" class="text-center">No storage accounts</td></tr>
                    {% endfor %}
                  </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```
*Self-correction*: The breadcrumb in `storage_accounts.html` uses `<ul>`. The Minton theme, like Bootstrap, typically uses `<ol class="breadcrumb">`. This should be consistent with `base_material.html`. The table in `storage_accounts.html` uses generic `table table-striped`; it could be enhanced with Minton's specific datatable classes if advanced features are desired.

## 5. Future Considerations

*   **JavaScript Components:** Many components in the Minton theme (DataTables, charts, form pickers, etc.) rely on specific JavaScript libraries and initialization code. As new features are added to CIELO, the corresponding JS from `material/assets/js/` and example initialization code from `material/*.html` files will need to be included in the `{% block extra_js %}` of relevant templates.
*   **Form Styling:** When implementing forms, refer to `material/forms-elements.html` or `material/forms-advanced.html` for styling form inputs, selects, checkboxes, etc., to match the theme.
*   **Further Component Usage:** The `material/` directory contains a wealth of pre-styled components (modals, notifications, widgets, etc.) that can be adopted as needed.

This integration provides CIELO with a rich and consistent visual foundation, significantly improving the user experience.
